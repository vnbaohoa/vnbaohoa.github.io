    <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Cube Sweeper Robot was developed for the Messy Room Competition, where autonomous robots 
        attempt to clear their side of a divided playing field within one minute. Each team begins with 
        ten foam cubes scattered across their colored half, and the winner is determined by who has the 
        fewest cubes left on their side at the end of the match.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our robot was designed around a simple but robust strategy: instead of detecting individual cubes, 
        it sweeps the board in wide lanes using servo-actuated arms. By moving in a programmed path and 
        pushing everything in its way, the robot minimizes detection errors and maximizes cube removal.
    </p>

<section id="system-overview">
    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Cube Sweeper Robot integrates mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems into a coordinated 
        autonomous machine:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanical System:</strong> A differential-drive chassis with two long servo-controlled 
            arms that fold down to push cubes across the center line. The bracket and arms were fully modeled 
            in SolidWorks and fabricated via 3D printing.</li>

        <li><strong>Electrical System:</strong> An Arduino Uno serves as the control hub, operating two 
            continuous-rotation drive servos, two standard servos for the sweeping arms, a TCS3200 color sensor 
            for field region detection, and four QTI infrared sensors for boundary following.</li>

        <li><strong>Software System:</strong> A multi-process state machine coordinates navigation, turning, 
            sweeping, and recovery behaviors. Timing-based motor control, calibrated turning constants, and 
            sensor-driven transitions determine how the robot sweeps lane by lane across the board.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="design">
    <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        My primary responsibility was the embedded software and sensing integration. I began by verifying 
        basic servo operation, writing low-level drive functions, and testing sensor behavior individually. 
        As the mechanical design matured, I integrated the TCS3200 and QTI sensors, building custom test 
        scripts to understand their characteristics and develop reliable thresholds.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3D-printed bracket and arm system required several refinements to ensure adequate clearance for 
        wiring, correct orientation for the sensors, and stable mounting for the servos. During development, 
        we identified that wire pinch points caused servo failures, which influenced later design iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
        A significant challenge was tuning the robot’s turning accuracy. Because the robot lacks encoders, 
        I implemented a timing-based calibration routine that recorded how long the robot needed to turn 
        exactly 90° and 180°. These values were incorporated into the main code to improve repeatability 
        during sweeping cycles.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="sensing-control">
    <h2>Sensing and Control Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        My main contribution was the development of the sensing algorithms and control state machine. The 
        QTI sensors provide real-time detection of the black boundary, allowing the robot to follow the right 
        edge at the start of each sweep. The TCS3200 color sensor detects changes from our team color to the 
        opponent’s, indicating when the robot reaches the center line or the far side.
    </p>
    <p>
        The robot’s behavior is divided into structured processes: border following, turning toward center, 
        sweeping with arms deployed, reversing, and shifting to the next lane. Each transition is triggered 
        by either sensor feedback or calibrated time thresholds. To improve straight-line tracking, I implemented 
        a QTI-based tuning routine that adjusts left/right drive pulses and averages the corrections into calibrated 
        values for all later processes.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="testing">
    <h2>Testing and Performance</h2>
    <p>
        Extensive testing was performed on servo calibration, color sensor thresholds, and QTI discharge timing. 
        The robot reliably distinguished red, blue, and black regions and demonstrated stable border tracking 
        during practice runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the competition, the robot successfully executed several full sweeps and pushed a large number 
        of cubes to the opposing side. However, high movement speed and lighting variations caused occasional 
        delays in boundary detection. In one match, the robot overshot the black line and left the playfield due 
        to insufficient sensor sampling time at high speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite these challenges, the system demonstrated strong integration across all subsystems and effectively 
        executed the sweeping strategy under normal conditions.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        The competition revealed several important engineering lessons. Timing-based control, while simple, is 
        inherently sensitive to disturbances such as cube collisions, friction changes, and servo inconsistencies. 
        Future designs would benefit from closed-loop heading control using encoders or an IMU to improve turn 
        accuracy and long-distance alignment. Additionally, the TCS3200 proved sensitive to lighting conditions, 
        suggesting that adaptive thresholds or filtering could significantly improve robustness.
    </p>
    <p>
        The QTI sensors worked as expected at moderate speeds, but high-speed motion reduced the time available 
        for accurate discharge measurement. Incorporating speed-dependent sampling or slowing the robot near 
        expected boundaries would make detection more reliable. Overall, the project strengthened my skills in 
        embedded programming, sensor calibration, and real-world robotic debugging.
